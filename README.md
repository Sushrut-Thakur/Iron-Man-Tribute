# Iron-Man-Tribute
## [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) Project: To build a tribute page

A Tribute page is the first project in the "Responsive Web Design" certification course on freeCodeCamp. The objective is to create a page which gives information about a person and their work.
I have created a tribute page for **Tony Stark "Iron Man"**.

---

The technologies used for this project are **HTML** and **CSS** only. The page is highly responsive for devices of all sizes.
It passed all the tests specified by freeCodeCamp.

### Test Cases

1. The tribute page should have an element with a corresponding `id="main"`, which contains all other elements.

2. There should be an element with a corresponding `id="title"`, which contains text that describes the subject of the tribute page.

3. There should be a `div` element with a corresponding `id="img-div"`.

4. Within the `img-div` element, there should be an `img` element with a corresponding `id="image"`.

5. Within the `img-div` element, there should be an element with a corresponding `id="img-caption"` that contains textual content describing the image shown in `img-div`.

6. There should be an element with a corresponding `id="tribute-info"`, which contains textual content describing the subject of the tribute page.

7. There should be an a element with a corresponding `id="tribute-link"`, which links to an outside site that contains additional information about the subject of the tribute page. The link must open in a new tab on the browser.

8. The `img` element should responsively resize, relative to the width of its parent element, without exceeding its original size.

9. The `img` element should be centered within its parent element.
